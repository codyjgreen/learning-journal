this week was stressful! as i imagine all of 401 will be between having to make sure things were all caught up to losing thursday going to my meetup. and then just the challenge that we had on the lab 12 and 13 not to mention the test, i probably could have gone bald or freaked out but luckily i had a good partner in mitch who just kept chugging along and working and we had great help from our instructor and TA's it was another great week. i am very excited to start projects this week and see who my team will be and im hoping for a second chance at that test i know i can do better!
