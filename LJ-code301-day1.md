I had a great week! There was time where already i felt like an imposter in the fact that on some code wars i felt like i didnt know what i was doing at all but with some research and refreshers from googling i was able to come out on top.

Pair programming went well this week aaron was a good partner and we worked well together.

i am looking forward to this next week and the rest of the course!
